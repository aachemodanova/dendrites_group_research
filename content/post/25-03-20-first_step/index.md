## TITLE: Group project "Dendrite growth". Stage 1: The scientific problem of the project

## General information
Our research group is working on a project on "Dendrite growth," in which we explore a mathematical model of this process.

## Relevance
The appearance of dendrites plays a key role in metallurgy and in foundry production, especially during the solidification of metals and alloys, since the microstructure of the resulting dendrites largely determines the mechanical, electrical and thermal properties of the obtained materials. Studying their characteristics is important not only for a theoretical understanding of crystallization processes, but also for practice, for improving production technologies of modern materials with specified properties. 
Thus, the scientific problem is to develop theoretical and numerical models capable of accurately predicting the dynamics of dendrite growth and their effect on the microstructure of formed materials.

## Object and subject of research
- Dendrites, 
- Crystalline dendrites

## Goals 
To investigate the dendrite growth model

## Tasks
Consider a combined model of dendrite growth
Consider an algorithm for constructing a model of dendrite growth
To build a model of dendrite growth
, investigate the time dependence of the number of particles in an aggregate and its RMS radius in different modes.

# Definition

A dendrite is a crystal that develops with a typical branching shape resembling a fractal.  In metals, they are formed during crystallization from a supercooled melt.

# Result
The first stage of the group project on "Dendrite growth" was completed, as a result of which we examined materials on a scientific problem, made a theoretical description of the dendrite growth model and identified the tasks of further research.
