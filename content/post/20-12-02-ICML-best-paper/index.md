The first stage of the group project on the topic "Scientific problem of the Dendrite Growth project" was completed.

<!--more-->

The appearance of dendrites plays a key role in metallurgy and in foundry production, especially during the solidification of metals and alloys, since the microstructure of the resulting dendrites largely determines the mechanical, electrical and thermal properties of the obtained materials. Studying their characteristics is important not only for a theoretical understanding of crystallization processes, but also for practice, for improving production technologies of modern materials with specified properties. Thus, the scientific problem is to develop theoretical and numerical models capable of accurately predicting the dynamics of dendrite growth and their effect on the microstructure of formed materials.

A dendrite is a crystal that develops with a typical branching shape resembling a fractal. In metals, they are formed during crystallization from a supercooled melt.
